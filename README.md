##Project purpose
We've created this classic game with the sole purpose of our user having fun. After creating a custom hero, one is able to advance its statistics by strategically fighting with different enemies. There are three difficulty levels of the dungeones with enemies, so we can make sure that the game continues to be challenging and engaging even after the hero has progressed toward a higher level with better stats. And even if this somehow fails to satisfy the user, they can always create a brand new hero with different skills that would freshen up the gaming experience all over again.
